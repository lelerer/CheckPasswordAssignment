# Password Validation Program

This is a simple password validation program that checks 3 criteria:
length, the presence of letters and digits, and whether the password contains full English words.


### How to run locally
1. Download the files.
2. Run the local server on your computer by opening a terminal and navigate to the directory, and run the command 'http-server'. 
3. This will start a local server, and it will provide you with a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
4. Open this URL in your browser and you're good to go.

4. The program will check the password against specified criteria and display the result.

### Password Requirements
1. Length of 8-16 characters.
2. Contains letters of the Latin alphabet and at least one digit.

### Customizing Word List
If you want to customize the list of words used for validation or include more languages' letters, it can be easily done by replacing the content of the wordList.txt file with your own list of words.
